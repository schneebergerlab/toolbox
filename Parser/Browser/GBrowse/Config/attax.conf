## - 2 display modes: overview (50k+) and detail (<50k)
##   overview shows segmentation gene model without predicted intron/exon probe boundaries
##   detail shows predicted intron/exon probe boundaries connected by dashed line
## - color get's assigned by function segmentation_color (defined in init_code)
## - to prevent stacking at >20k overviews bump density is set to 5 features
