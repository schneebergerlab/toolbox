```bash
new_perl_script.pl raw|fasta
```

Generates a new plain perl script (`raw`) or a perl script that includes a fasta parser (`fasta`). 


```bash
slidingWINDOW.pl
```

See command line usage. Requires all positions - might need an update to be more generic.


```bash
toolbox_add_header.pl
```

Not in use, not finished. Can be used to add a header to all scripts in the toolbox repository - should be iterative.
